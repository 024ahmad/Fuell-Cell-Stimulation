      <div class="info-content">
        <p>A fuel cell is a device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy in a reaction in which hydrogen is oxidized to produce water.</p>
        <p>Fuel cells have less heat loss, making them more energy-efficient than conventional fuel systems.</p>
        <p>The fuel cell consists of a fuel electrode(-) for supplying hydrogen, an air electrode(+) for supplying oxygen, and an electrolyte between the two electrodes.</p>
        
        <p>The only substance emitted by the fuel cell is water. Therefore, fuel cells (not like fossil fuels) do not emit carbon dioxide, making them environmentally friendly. Besides, little noise is produced when producing electricity.</p>
        <p>However, fuel cells' commercialization requires various technical problems such as electrode material development, mass production, storage, and transportation of hydrogen.</p>
